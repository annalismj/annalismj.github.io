        	<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>What is the first thing that comes to mind when you hear “trojan horse”? Is it danger? A nice gift? Perhaps you know how the Trojan Horse story ends. It was subterfuge that the Greeks used to enter the independent city of Troy and win the war. We are not in that kind of war, but possibly in a war between people; people who want to move forward in the use of technology, and people who want to have an equal system, where many options are available. Cashless payment is a manifestation of it. While many people are comfortable using cash, the rest of them, principally corporations and the government, want to eradicate totally that method, looking to implement the use of digital solutions to pay for services and products. But how good is this new era? Is it so good to be true, or is there actually something underneath? 
Although I am aware that technology is a great part of life, I do not support the idea of having less privacy by using just electronic payment, because it is unfair that we have to expose our data for the “convenience” of being in a cashless society.  Perhaps, at the end of this paper you will agree with me.</p>
		<div>
        <p>Is the idea of the “cashless society” from this century, and what is the actual state of its implementation? In 1998, the Singapore government started to promote and put into practice this system, but it failed demonstrating that the adoption of electronic payments requires more than just infrastructure alone. In this instance, there were simply too few merchants who were prepared to accept credit cards for online shopping<sup id="cite_ref-z_1-0" class="reference separada"><a href="#cite_note-z-1"><span class="corchete-llamada">[</span>1<span class="corchete-llamada">]</span></a></sup>. Nowadays with more experience in the market, some countries advanced considerably. Sweden is one of them. The Swedish central bank, Riksbank, reported that in 2018 only 13% of Sweden’s payments were made using cash, compared with a European average of nearly 80%. In South Korea, the central bank has set a 2020 target to phase out coins. The European Central Bank has decided that there will be no new issues of 500-euro notes<sup id="cite_ref-a_2-1" class="reference separada"><a href="#cite_note-a-2"><span class="corchete-llamada">[</span>2<span class="corchete-llamada">]</span></a></sup>.</p>
      <div>
      <p>Is it proportional what are you giving compared to what are you receiving from electronic payment? If you think about it, perhaps you will say yes, because you are able to experience the convenient side of this currency. You have effortless payment, all the money in one place. If someone steals from you, you can cancel your credit card and make the bank aware of what happened. You won’t receive “fake money” in return after a payment. Also, you won’t be limited in the purchase process, you can spend all your money even without realizing it, and while with cash you know exactly what do you have.</p>
	<div>
    <p>What are you giving up in exchange? Putting aside the positives and being realistic, not everyone has access to a credit card, which creates even more division between people, and social classes can be more accentuated with just one currency. Also, there is a key element that it is part of electronic payment: data. Some purchases are not simple and fast just because they are made with credit card, but thanks to the data that you provided previously to a certain website or application, or the data that is storage in your bank account. Data is reflected as home addresses, full name, telephone, your relative’s information, what do you like or dislike, credentials like user name or password, and even your appearance.</p>
<div>
    <p>The transactions can be also tracked, storing data in systems which we have no control over, giving us zero anonymity. This can be an easy way for corporations and hackers to create a profile about us, knowing in detail what we do, what we will do and how we think in general. We should not ignore the number of data breaches. Credential stuffing attacks are a form of cyberattacks, where the login data from any kind of account is stolen. In 2017, credential stuffing attacks made up, on average, 80-90% of an online retailer’s login traffic, and it is estimated that the US consumer banking industry faces nearly $50 Million per day in potential losses due to credential stuffing attacks<sup id="cite_ref-w_3-0" class="reference separada"><a href="#cite_note-w-3"><span class="corchete-llamada">[</span>3<span class="corchete-llamada">]</span></a></sup>. Even lab testing can face this kind of issues. Quest Diagnostics, revealed that an unauthorized user gained access to information on nearly 11.9 million patients, including credit card numbers and bank account information<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference separada"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span class="corchete-llamada">[</span>4<span class="corchete-llamada">]</span></a></sup>. If such an alarming amount of breaches can happen in a divided system, how much will it increase in a cashless society? If "refusing cash payment" is legalized, mobile payment will no longer be a voluntary choice, but a forced necessity on consumers. Not only will they lose the right to choose the means of payment, but their economic interests will also be exposed to risks<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference separada"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span class="corchete-llamada">[</span>5<span class="corchete-llamada">]</span></a></sup>.</p>
    <div>
    <p>It may be reasonable to think that the government will protect us, and that politicians will make the best decisions for the society, but unfortunately the reality says otherwise. Political campaigns also benefit from electronic payment. Most of the promises in a campaign are never fulfilled, but for creating these declarations it is necessary to be in each citizen’s mind. This is not done going door by door, but analyzing the data that somehow, we give away, even the most insignificant. Simple tasks or behaviors like subscribing to an online web, buying certain products in specific locations or requesting services, help to corrupt politicians to deceive and manipulate people. A convincing campaign that shows us how our difficulties can be finally over, is created after turning little pieces of information into elaborated speeches. Facebook and Google now play a central role in political operations, offering a full spectrum of commercial digital marketing tools and techniques, along with specialized ad “products” designed for political use<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference separada"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span class="corchete-llamada">[</span>6<span class="corchete-llamada">]</span></a></sup>.</p>
    <div>
    <p>I strongly believe that it is too risky to be part of a cashless society. I consider that we should have control of our own privacy, otherwise there won’t be anything left for us. If privacy violation has already happened to other people, it could also happen to you, for that reason you must take the necessary actions to protect yourself by: reading what you accept on the internet, changing your passwords frequently, having control of your personal data using it only on secure websites, avoid sharing your card details through social media, avoid clicking in unknown links, and investigating more about this topic. The government is responsible for deciding whether the country is cashless or not, for that reason I recommend decision makers to take into consideration that setting limits is also crucial for finding harmony, it is not about going totally contactless or concentrating on just cash payments, it is about reaching a middle point where people can have the option of how protected they want to be. The government should enforce existing laws on data protection, policy reforms are also required, and a fair punishment for those who perform malevolent cyber activity. Do not be distracted by the appearance of advanced technology and new systems, pay attention to what is inside them and from whom they come.</p>
